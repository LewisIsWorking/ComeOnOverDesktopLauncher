# CoODL — Build & tooling gotchas

Extracted from `LEARNINGS.md` during v1.9.2 to keep the root file under the 200-line limit. These are accumulated gotchas from doing releases of this codebase.

## Git hooks (one-time setup per clone)
The repo ships a `pre-push` hook in `docs/dev/hooks/` that runs the full test suite before every push. Install it once after cloning:
```powershell
# Windows (Git for Windows -- no chmod needed, sh.exe runs it automatically)
Copy-Item docs\dev\hooks\pre-push .git\hooks\pre-push
```
```bash
# Unix / macOS
cp docs/dev/hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```
The hook runs `dotnet test --verbosity quiet`. If any test fails the push is aborted. To bypass in a genuine emergency: `git push --no-verify` (fix the test, don't skip it).
The hook is not auto-installed by git on clone ÔÇö it lives in `docs/dev/hooks/` rather than `.git/hooks/` so it's tracked in version control and survives re-clones.## Line-count audit command

Run this any time you suspect drift. It's also what the CI guard (`FileSizeLimitTests`) checks:

```powershell
$root = "$env:USERPROFILE\RiderProjects\ComeOnOverDesktopLauncher"
Get-ChildItem -Path $root -Recurse -File -Include *.cs, *.axaml, *.md |
    Where-Object { $_.FullName -notmatch "\\(bin|obj|TestResults|\.git|node_modules)\\" } |
    ForEach-Object {
        $lines = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllLines($_.FullName).Count
        [PSCustomObject]@{ Lines = $lines; File = $_.FullName.Replace("$root\", "") }
    } |
    Where-Object { $_.Lines -gt 200 } |
    Sort-Object -Property Lines -Descending |
    Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Do NOT use `Measure-Object -Line` — it undercounts on files with the final newline missing. Always use `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllLines($path).Count`.

## Kill the running launcher before rebuilding

```powershell
Get-Process -Name "ComeOnOverDesktopLauncher" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
```

If the launcher is running, `dotnet build` fails with `MSB3027: The file is locked by: "ComeOnOverDesktopLauncher (PID)"` because msbuild can't overwrite the DLL. Always kill before building after a live-run session.

## PowerShell / heredoc quirks in this codebase

- `$PID` is a read-only PowerShell automatic variable. Use `$procId` instead.
- Files use LF line endings (enforced by `.gitattributes`). When doing replacements with Set-Content, use `$LF = "`n"` rather than `"`r`n"`.
- Single-quoted heredoc `@'...'@` preserves C# `$"..."` interpolation. Double-quoted `@"..."@` eats the `$`.
- For multi-line git commit messages: **always** write to `$env:TEMP\*.txt` then `git commit -F <tempfile>`, never pipe a heredoc directly to `git commit -m`. Piping breaks on PowerShell line-continuation rules. Delete the temp file after.

## Working directory drift

Some `start_process` / `bash` calls spawn a subshell with `bin/Debug/` as the cwd (because the last process the current shell ran was in that directory). Always start commands with an explicit `Set-Location` or `cd` to the repo root. Symptom is `ReadAllLines` with paths like `bin\Debug\net10.0\ComeOnOverDesktopLauncher.Core\...`.

## CI runner gotchas

### ImageMagick

The GitHub Actions release workflow does NOT have ImageMagick installed. Always commit the pre-rasterised binaries (`.ico`, `.png`) alongside the SVG source. The SVG + `build-icons.ps1` live at `docs/design/` as the regeneration path.

### .NET 10 on the CI runner

Historically the workflow did a `regex net10.0 → net9.0` substitution before `dotnet publish` because `windows-latest` runners didn't have .NET 10 preinstalled. In v1.10.0 we simplified this: `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` supports `dotnet-version: '10.0.x'` directly — the action downloads and installs the SDK when it's not preinstalled. No regex hack needed. The build now targets `net10.0` end-to-end.

## Commit message temp files — `.gitignore` them

`COMMIT_MSG.tmp` slipped into the v1.8.0 commit because the staging step (`git add -A`) ran before the cleanup step. `.gitignore` now has:

```
COMMIT_MSG.tmp
*.commit.tmp
```

Better: write commit messages to `$env:TEMP`, which is outside the repo tree entirely.

## Screenshot workflow

For fresh ROADMAP screenshots:

1. Kill running launcher
2. `dotnet build` (confirms 0 warnings)
3. Start detached: `Start-Process -FilePath "dotnet" -ArgumentList 'run','--no-build','-c','Debug'`
4. Sleep 10s for Avalonia startup
5. Restore + size via `SetWindowPos` — maximised windows may report coords on a different monitor
6. `PrintWindow` with flag=2 into a `Bitmap`, save PNG to `docs/screenshots/photo_YYYY-MM-DD_vX.Y.Z.png`
7. Copy to Claude via `Filesystem:copy_file_user_to_claude` and view it to confirm the right window was captured
8. If the screenshot is wrong content: it means the window was hidden under another. Explicitly `SetForegroundWindow` + 500ms sleep, retry.

## UI Automation for launcher verification

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName UIAutomationClient
$proc = Get-Process -Id <launcher-pid>
$root = [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::FromHandle($proc.MainWindowHandle)
$texts = $root.FindAll([System.Windows.Automation.TreeScope]::Descendants,
    (New-Object System.Windows.Automation.PropertyCondition(
        [System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement]::ControlTypeProperty,
        [System.Windows.Automation.ControlType]::Text)))
$texts | ForEach-Object { "  '$($_.Current.Name)'" }
```

This reads the actual rendered text, which is what the user sees — far more reliable than inferring from XAML.

## Release checklist

Before every tag:

- [ ] Kill running launcher
- [ ] `dotnet build` — 0 warnings, 0 errors
- [ ] `dotnet test --nologo --verbosity minimal` — 100% pass, zero skips
- [ ] Line-count audit (see command above) — no files > 200 lines
- [ ] Bump `<Version>` + `<AssemblyVersion>` in csproj
- [ ] ROADMAP.md — move current work from "Planned" to "Released", with design rationale comments
- [ ] Fresh screenshot referenced in the ROADMAP section
- [ ] `git status` — no stray files like `COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
- [ ] Commit via `git commit -F $env:TEMP\commit-msg.txt`
- [ ] `git tag vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] `git push origin master` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Poll `gh run list --limit 1` every 30-60s until green (~2m)
- [ ] `gh release view vX.Y.Z` — confirm both `.exe` and `.zip` assets published

## Extension install errors that aren't errors

If Claude's extension page shows `ENOTEMPTY: rmdir .../readable-stream`, check if the user is trying to install Desktop Commander. That extension is a **2.2 GB compressed MCPB download** (Puppeteer + Chromium + ffmpeg bundle). Claude's installer shows no progress UI and takes ~7-10 minutes. The "error" is almost always the user cancelling + retrying, leaving a half-deleted node_modules tree that a second install attempt can't clean up.

Recovery: close the slot fully (including tray icon), delete the whole `ant.dir.gh.wonderwhy-er.desktopcommandermcp` folder, reopen slot, reinstall, wait 10 minutes.

Download progress lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClaudeSlotN\logs\main.log` — grep `[download:`.

## Velopack packaging

The CI workflow + packaging mechanics for v1.10.0's auto-update migration moved to [`VELOPACK.md`](VELOPACK.md) during v1.10.1 to keep this file under the 200-line limit. Covers: local `vpk pack` iteration, the `PublishSingleFile=false` invariant, why `VelopackApp.Build()` lives in `Program.Main`, code-signing future plans, post-ship validation strategy, `fetch-depth: 0` on checkout, the `--token` vs `GITHUB_TOKEN` gotcha, and how to generate delta packages.
