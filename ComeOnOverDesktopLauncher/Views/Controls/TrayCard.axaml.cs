/// <para>
/// Structurally mirrors <see cref="SlotCard"/> but with three key
/// differences: the thumbnail carries a "Hidden" badge overlay and
/// shows at reduced opacity (to communicate stale / frozen state);
/// the nickname is read-only italic (the user cannot usefully edit a
/// name they cannot see in the slot window); the bottom button reads
/// "Quit" instead of "X" because there is no longer a visible window
/// whose state needs protecting behind a confirm dialog.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// Tap-to-enlarge works on tray cards too - the preview service
/// falls back to the last captured frame when fresh capture fails
/// (which it will for tray-resident windows since their main window
/// handle is gone). Uses <c>PointerPressed</c> for the same reason
/// as <see cref="SlotCard"/>.
