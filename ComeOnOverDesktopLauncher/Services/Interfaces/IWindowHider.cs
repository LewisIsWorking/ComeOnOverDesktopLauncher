/// Added in v1.10.5. Motivation: before this, the only way to hide
/// a slot was to use Claude's own close-to-tray (via the window's
/// minimise/close button), which requires bringing the slot to the
/// foreground first. A Hide button on the launcher's slot card means
/// the user can park a slot without context-switching to it.

/// The Show-from-tray side of the feature is intentionally NOT here
/// (deferred to v1.10.6). Showing a hidden window requires enumerating
/// all top-level windows (visible and hidden) to find the one
/// belonging to the target PID - <c>Process.MainWindowHandle</c>
/// returns <c>IntPtr.Zero</c> for hidden windows. Users can still
/// re-show a hidden slot via Claude's own system-tray icon in the
/// meantime; the existing tray-resident detection already surfaces
/// hidden slots in the launcher's TrayCard list, closing the loop.
