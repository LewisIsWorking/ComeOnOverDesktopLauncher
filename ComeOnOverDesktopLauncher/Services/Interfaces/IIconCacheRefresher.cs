/// Added in v1.10.3 after observing on 2026-04-20 that when
/// <see cref="IShortcutHealer"/> recreated a missing Start Menu .lnk
/// on Lewis's machine, Windows Search still displayed the generic
/// document icon for minutes afterwards because the shell's icon
/// cache retained the previous broken state. The fix documented by
/// Microsoft is <c>ie4uinit.exe -show</c> (a utility shipped with
/// Windows that forces Explorer to reload icons without interrupting
/// the user). Wrapped behind an interface so
/// <see cref="IShortcutHealer"/> can be unit-tested without actually
/// spawning the process.

/// Only called on the <see cref="ShortcutHealResult.HealedMissing"/>

/// doesn't need a refresh (nothing changed on disk) and the refresh
/// is cheap but not free (tiny process spawn), so firing it
/// unnecessarily on every launcher startup would be wasteful.
