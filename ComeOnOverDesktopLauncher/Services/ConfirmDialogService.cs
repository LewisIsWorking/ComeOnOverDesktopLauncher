/// <summary>
/// Default <see cref="IConfirmDialogService"/> implementation. Locates the
/// active <see cref="Avalonia.Controls.Window"/> via the current classic
/// desktop application lifetime and opens a <see cref="ConfirmDialog"/>
/// modally against it.
///
/// Fast path: when the caller is already on the UI thread (the common
/// case - tick-timer-driven VMs and button-click handlers), opens the
/// dialog directly and awaits its result. When called from a background
/// thread, marshals to the UI thread first via
/// <see cref="Dispatcher.UIThread"/> before opening the dialog.
///
/// Returns <c>false</c> rather than throwing when no owner window is
/// available (application is shutting down, or called before the main
/// window is up): callers then naturally degrade to "user didn't confirm"
/// semantics instead of bubbling an exception through an async click
/// handler. A warning is logged when this happens so the situation is
/// visible in the log rather than silently dropped.
