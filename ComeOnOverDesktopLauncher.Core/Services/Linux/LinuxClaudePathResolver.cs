/// passing "$@" through, so the launcher's --user-data-dir=... arg
/// works the same way as on Windows.

/// <para>v1.10.19 MVP: hard-codes the canonical path. A more thorough
/// resolver could check $PATH and inspect alternative install
/// locations (snap, flatpak, AppImage), but that is deferred to a
