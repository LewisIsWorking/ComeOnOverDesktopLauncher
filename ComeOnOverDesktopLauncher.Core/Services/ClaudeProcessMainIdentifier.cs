/// <para>
/// Rule: a claude.exe is a <b>main</b> process iff its parent is NOT
/// also a claude.exe. Electron's browser process is the root of its
/// own process tree; every child (renderer, GPU, utility) has the
/// main process as its parent. So if you walk the set of running
/// claude.exe PIDs and check each one's <c>ParentProcessId</c>, the
/// ones whose parents aren't in the same set are the mains.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// This identification is orthogonal to window visibility: a
/// close-to-tray'd slot still has a main process (just with
/// <c>MainWindowHandle == 0</c>). The scanner uses this to surface
/// tray-resident slots instead of dropping them with the old
/// windowed-only filter.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// Extracted from <see cref="WmiClaudeProcessScanner"/> so the scanner
/// stays under the 200-line limit and so the classification rule can
/// be unit-tested without needing a real WMI provider.
