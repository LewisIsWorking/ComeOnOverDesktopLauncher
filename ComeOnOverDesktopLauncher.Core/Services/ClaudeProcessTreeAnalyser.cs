/// Claude Desktop is an Electron application. Each visible window
/// ("main" process) spawns roughly 10-15 child processes: renderer,
/// GPU, crashpad handler, audio/video utility, network service, and
/// node-service. Task Manager's per-app RAM/CPU figures sum the entire
/// tree; CoODL's per-slot cards should match that total.
/// </para>

/// Extracted from <see cref="WmiClaudeProcessScanner"/> in v1.10.9
/// to keep the scanner under 200 lines and to make the tree-walking
/// logic unit-testable independently of WMI.
